1. We could try to set up a callback function that when a habit is added, 
a result with the default values is added with an autoincrementing id and 
autoincrementing date id starting at 1, then use a put route to update from false 
to true or back to false when the user clicks

2. We can aim to make a post request that creates a result value only once it is
clicked with a default value of true, then make a delete request if they click on a
value if TRUE to delete the result altogether 

* for either option, we will need to use bubbling to select the column (habit) and row (date) names 
when the cell is selected, we will then need to make a get route (i believe) to request the id
from the habit_title and from the date from our DB.
We grab (query.selector) from the document and send in the body of a fetch req to the end point set up for
the query
the returned id values can then be used in the second query/part of the query to update or create that result
